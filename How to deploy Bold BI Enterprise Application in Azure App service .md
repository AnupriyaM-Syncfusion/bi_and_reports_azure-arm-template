Bold BI supports Basic, Standard and Premium App Service plans in the Azure. The minimum recommended App Service plan to run the application is the Basic plan.
To get better performance, can scale up the App Service plan from Basic to Standard or Premium plans. Please find the below documentation links on how to scale up and scale out the App Service plan.
